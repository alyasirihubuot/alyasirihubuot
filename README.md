Hi there! 👋 I'm @alyasirihubuot
🚀 Computer & Control Engineering Student | Future Full-Stack & AI Developer | Tech Explorer

I'm a first-year Computer & Control Engineering student at the University of Technology in Iraq. I'm at the beginning of my programming journey, sharpening my skills to become a Full-Stack Developer and AI Engineer. I’m passionate about building practical solutions, learning new technologies, and making an impact through software.

💡 Interests & Skills:
💻 Software Development – Building clean, functional, and scalable applications
🧠 AI & Machine Learning – Exploring intelligent systems and data-driven solutions
📊 Algorithms & Problem Solving – Enhancing logic and performance
🌐 SaaS Systems – Designing smart, service-based platforms
🎨 Graphic Design – Blending creativity with tech

🌍 Projects & Achievements:
🚗 Aman – Digital Car Insurance App
A startup project born in a 72-hour global entrepreneurship hackathon (2024), where we reached the Top 8 out of 60+ teams.
The app simplifies vehicle insurance through full digitalization. We pitched it to Al-Hamraa Insurance Company, built a prototype, and held 3 negotiation rounds. Although the project was handed to another firm, I’m now reworking it as a SaaS platform to offer it to multiple companies.

🔐 Smart Security Gate – Department Exhibition Project (2025)
A simple automated gate using Arduino R3, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and custom logic.
I worked on the hardware wiring and full software logic with a teammate.

🎓 UNITECH Ambassador – Hub 200 Program
Representing my university in an initiative that connects students with real-world market demands, offering training in marketing, entrepreneurship, and project management.
